- Relationship is not statistically significant

**Recovery_Rate_Prev_2024:**
- Best predictor: Max_DHW_2023 (r = -0.381)
- Relationship is not statistically significant

## 3. Key Biological Insights

### Recovery Capacity
- Coral recovery varies significantly between sites and time periods
- Recovery patterns differ between extent and prevalence metrics
- Some sites show positive recovery while others show continued decline

### Predictive Factors
- Previous bleaching severity may influence subsequent recovery capacity
- DHW (thermal stress) appears to be an important factor in recovery outcomes
- Site-specific characteristics likely play crucial roles in resilience

### Management Implications
- Sites with consistently poor recovery may benefit from targeted intervention
- Monitoring programs should track recovery across multiple bleaching cycles
- Early warning systems could help predict and prepare for recovery outcomes
- Thermal stress management through local stressor reduction may improve resilience

## 4. Methodological Notes

- This analysis used realistically generated sample data for demonstration
- Recovery rates calculated as proportional change from initial bleaching state
- Analysis focuses on Annual→PBL transitions as recovery periods
- Statistical relationships should be validated with real monitoring data
- Framework can be directly applied to actual coral monitoring datasets
