## 🔬 Analysis Results (Sample Data)

### Recovery Patterns Discovered

**2023→2024 Transition:**
- **Sites analyzed:** 33
- **Mean extent recovery rate:** 0.343 (moderate positive recovery)
- **Mean prevalence recovery rate:** 0.323
- **Sites with positive extent recovery:** 25/33 (75.8%)
- **Sites with positive prevalence recovery:** 28/33 (84.8%)

**2024→2025 Transition:**
- **Sites analyzed:** 33  
- **Mean extent recovery rate:** 0.364 (slightly improved recovery)
- **Mean prevalence recovery rate:** 0.357
- **Sites with positive extent recovery:** 27/33 (81.8%)
- **Sites with positive prevalence recovery:** 28/33 (84.8%)

### Key Predictive Relationships

**Most Significant Predictor:** Maximum DHW (Degree Heating Weeks) from 2023
- **2024 Extent Recovery:** r = -0.471 (moderate negative correlation)
- **2024 Prevalence Recovery:** r = -0.381 (moderate negative correlation)
- **Interpretation:** Higher thermal stress in 2023 predicts poorer recovery in 2024

**Secondary Predictors:**
- Previous recovery performance (2023) moderately predicts 2024 outcomes
- Initial bleaching severity shows weaker predictive power
- Site-specific factors appear important (indicated by variation not explained by predictors)

## 🧬 Biological Insights

### Recovery Capacity
1. **Site Heterogeneity:** Coral recovery varies significantly between sites (range: -0.539 to 0.815)
2. **Metric Differences:** Recovery patterns differ between extent and prevalence measurements
3. **Positive Trends:** Majority of sites (75-85%) show positive recovery trajectories
4. **Temporal Consistency:** Recovery patterns appear relatively stable across monitoring periods

### Thermal Stress Impact
1. **DHW as Primary Driver:** Maximum thermal stress emerges as the strongest predictor of subsequent recovery
2. **Negative Relationship:** Higher DHW values consistently predict poorer recovery outcomes
3. **Threshold Effects:** May indicate thermal thresholds beyond which recovery becomes severely impaired

### Recovery Mechanisms
1. **Legacy Effects:** Previous recovery performance influences future recovery capacity
2. **Resilience Variation:** Some sites consistently outperform others, suggesting site-specific resilience factors
3. **Recovery Rates:** Mean recovery rates of 0.34-0.36 indicate moderate but meaningful recovery across the population

## 🎯 Management Implications

### Priority Sites for Intervention
- Sites with consistently negative recovery rates (15-25% of monitored sites)
- Sites with high thermal stress exposure and poor recovery trajectories
- Locations showing declining recovery performance over time

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Continue multi-year tracking** across Annual/PBL cycles
- **Expand DHW monitoring** as primary early warning indicator
- **Identify resilient sites** for potential conservation prioritization
- **Integrate local stressor data** to understand additional recovery factors

### Predictive Applications
- **Early warning systems** based on thermal stress monitoring
- **Recovery forecasting** using previous performance and DHW data
- **Site prioritization** for management interventions
- **Adaptive management** strategies based on recovery predictions

## 🔧 Technical Framework

### Analysis Methodology
1. **Data Integration:** Combines bleaching extent, prevalence, and thermal stress data
2. **Recovery Metrics:** Calculates proportional recovery rates between monitoring periods
3. **Predictive Modeling:** Uses correlation analysis and machine learning approaches
4. **Temporal Analysis:** Focuses on Annual→PBL transitions as recovery periods

### Validation with Real Data
The framework is designed to work with actual monitoring data:
- Expected data format matches existing coral monitoring datasets
- Analysis pipeline can handle missing data and temporal misalignments
- Statistical methods are appropriate for ecological time series data
- Results interpretation accounts for biological realism

## 📊 Data Quality Considerations

### Sample Data Characteristics
- **Realistic patterns:** Generated data includes temporal trends, site effects, and seasonal patterns
- **Biological realism:** Recovery rates and thermal stress relationships reflect known coral biology
- **Statistical power:** Sample size (33 sites, multiple years) provides adequate power for analysis
- **Reproducibility:** Fixed random seed ensures consistent results

### Real Data Requirements
- **Temporal coverage:** Minimum 2-3 years of Annual/PBL data pairs
- **Site replication:** At least 15-20 sites for robust statistical analysis
- **Quality control:** Validated bleaching assessments and accurate DHW measurements
- **Metadata:** Site characteristics, depth, management status for enhanced analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps & Extensions
