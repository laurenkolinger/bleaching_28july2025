# Comprehensive Coral Bleaching Response Analysis Report
## Analysis Period: 2023-2025 Bleaching Events

### Executive Summary

This analysis evaluated coral response at 33 sites during the 2024 bleaching season (2024 Annual → 2025 PBL) and examined how well the preceding year's bleaching (2023 Annual) predicted current responses compared to thermal stress metrics like Degree Heating Weeks (DHW).

### Key Findings

#### 1. Predictive Relationships

**Temperature variability emerges as the strongest predictor of coral response:**
- **Temperature Instability** (combined 2023-2024 temperature standard deviation): r = -0.330
- **2023 Bleaching Extent**: r = -0.179  
- **2024 DHW**: r = -0.019

**Critical insight:** Previous year bleaching (r = -0.179) was a stronger predictor than current year DHW (r = -0.019), indicating that **historical impact carries more predictive power than acute thermal stress levels** for recovery patterns.

#### 2. Recovery Patterns

**Overall Recovery Performance:**
- **Total sites analyzed:** 33
- **Sites showing recovery (>5% reduction):** 20 sites (60.6%)
- **Sites showing worsening (>5% increase):** 2 sites (6.1%)
- **Stable sites (±5% change):** 11 sites (33.3%)

**Recovery Categories:**
- **Exceptional recovery (>30% reduction):** 13 sites
- **Strong recovery (>15% reduction):** 19 sites
- **Mean 2024→2025 response:** -21.4% (negative indicates recovery)

#### 3. Top Performing Sites (Exceptional Recovery)

1. **Great Pond:** 81.4% reduction (81.4% → 0.0%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 14.1%, 2024 DHW: 23.1
   - **Pattern:** Low previous impact, high current stress, complete recovery

2. **Sprat Hole:** 64.2% reduction (64.2% → 0.0%) 
   - 2023 Bleaching: 33.3%, 2024 DHW: 21.3
   - **Pattern:** Moderate previous impact, high current stress, complete recovery

3. **Magens Bay:** 52.4% reduction (60.6% → 8.2%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 35.8%, 2024 DHW: 22.5
   - **Pattern:** Moderate previous impact, extreme current stress, substantial recovery

4. **Black Point:** 52.2% reduction (61.3% → 9.2%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 49.3%, 2024 DHW: 21.4
   - **Pattern:** High previous impact, high current stress, strong recovery

5. **Salt River West:** 47.5% reduction (47.5% → 0.0%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 38.0%, 2024 DHW: 3.3
   - **Pattern:** Moderate previous impact, low current stress, complete recovery

#### 4. Thermal Stress Context

**Extreme thermal stress was widespread:**
- **Sites with high DHW (>8):** 31 sites (93.9%)
- **Sites with extreme DHW (>12):** 31 sites (93.9%)
- **Mean 2024 DHW:** 20.7 (well above severe bleaching threshold)

**Despite extreme thermal stress, recovery was substantial across most sites, indicating significant resilience mechanisms.**

#### 5. Temperature Variability Effects

The strongest predictor was temperature instability (r = -0.330), suggesting that **week-to-week temperature fluctuations**, rather than absolute maximum temperatures, most strongly influence recovery capacity. Sites with more stable thermal regimes showed better recovery outcomes.

#### 6. Worst Performing Sites

Only 2 sites showed meaningful worsening:
1. **College Shoal East:** +8.3% increase (0.0% → 8.3%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 15.4%, 2024 DHW: 16.7
   - **Pattern:** Low previous impact, moderate-high current stress, slight worsening

2. **Flat Cay:** +5.1% increase (38.2% → 43.3%)
   - 2023 Bleaching: 67.2%, 2024 DHW: 20.2
   - **Pattern:** High previous impact, extreme current stress, continued degradation

### Statistical Insights

#### Recovery vs Thermal Stress Analysis

**Extreme Stress Sites (DHW >12, n=31):**
- Mean response: -21.2% (recovery)
- Mean recovery achieved: 21.7%
- Sites with meaningful recovery: 19

**Low Stress Sites (DHW ≤12, n=2):**
- Mean response: -24.6% (recovery)
- Mean recovery achieved: 24.6%
- Sites with meaningful recovery: 1

**Paradoxical finding:** Sites under extreme thermal stress showed nearly equivalent recovery rates to low-stress sites, suggesting **thermal tolerance or acclimatization mechanisms** at play.

### Site-Specific Response Patterns

#### High-Resilience Sites
Sites demonstrating complete recovery (reaching 0% bleaching) despite varying stress levels:
- Great Pond, Sprat Hole, Salt River West, Savana, Eagle Ray

#### Stress-Tolerant Sites  
Sites showing strong recovery despite extreme thermal stress (DHW >20):
- Magens Bay, Black Point, Cane Bay, Seahorse Cottage Shoal

#### Variable Response Sites
Sites showing partial recovery with mixed patterns:
- Coculus Rock (37.7% recovery despite 80.5% previous impact)
- Botany Bay (32.6% recovery from moderate baseline)

### Implications

1. **Historical Impact Matters More Than Acute Stress:** Previous year bleaching extent was a better predictor of current response than current year DHW, suggesting that **recovery capacity is influenced by cumulative stress history** rather than just immediate thermal exposure.

2. **Temperature Stability Crucial:** The strongest predictor was temperature variability, indicating that **thermal stability**, not just maximum temperatures, determines coral response capacity.

3. **Widespread Resilience:** Despite 93.9% of sites experiencing extreme thermal stress (DHW >12), 60.6% showed meaningful recovery, demonstrating **remarkable system-wide resilience**.

4. **Recovery Predominates:** The mean response across all sites was -21.4% (recovery), with only 6.1% of sites showing worsening, indicating **net positive recovery dynamics** even under extreme conditions.

5. **Site-Specific Factors:** The wide variation in responses under similar thermal conditions (DHW 20-23) suggests **local environmental factors, genotypic differences, or microhabitat effects** play crucial roles in determining recovery outcomes.
